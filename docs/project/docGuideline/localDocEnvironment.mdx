# Setup - Local Environment

:::info **The procedure described below applies to Windows users.**  
For those using MacOS or Linux, documentation will be added at a later date.  
:::

This section covers setting up the local development environment with WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) in order to edit the Dying Star project documentation. This environment allows you to edit pages with live previews in your browser.

This procedure will cover:

- [Installing a Linux distribution on Windows using WSL2](#install-wsl2)
- [Installing Make to set up the build environment](#install-make)
- [Installing GitKraken to work with existing Git versioning](#install-gitkraken)
- [Clone the repository](#clone-repository)
- [Installing Docker to run an instance in a virtual environment](#install-docker)
- [Installing Visual Studio Code](#install-visual-studio-code)
- [Start the development environment](#project-start-up)

## Install WSL2

### Prerequisites

Before enabling virtualization, make sure the following conditions are met:

- **CPU compatibility**: Most modern processors support virtualization technologies such as Intel VT-x or AMD-V. These features allow the CPU to run virtual machines efficiently.
- **BIOS / UEFI compatibility**: Recent systems generally provide a virtualization option directly within their BIOS / UEFI settings.
- **Windows Version**: You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below. If you are on earlier versions please see the [manual install page](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual).

:::info Virtualization is already enabled on many Windows devices.  
:::  
:::info Only modify what you need in the BIOS.  
:::

To run WSL 2, hardware virtualization must be enabled on your machine. Follow the steps below:

- Restart your computer. While it is booting, press the key that opens the BIOS/UEFI configuration panel (commonly `F1`, `F2`, `Delete`, `Escape` or `F10`)
- Once inside the BIOS/UEFI menu, look for sections such as `Advanced`, `Processor`, or `CPU Configuration`
- In the CPU configuration section, locate an option named `Intel Virtualization Technology`, `VT-x`, `AMD-V`, `SVM` or simply `Virtualisation` (the exact wording varies depending on the manufacturer)
- Enable the corresponding virtualization option
- Before exiting, make sure to save your changes (usually by pressing `F10` or using a “Save & Exit” menu)
- Restart your computer

</details>

### Install WSL

To install WSL and enable all required features, open PowerShell **as administrator** and run:

```bash
wsl --install
```

![wsl install command](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/wslInstall_01.png)

Once the process completes, restart your computer.

:::note Custom Distribution  
By default, Ubuntu will be the Linux distribution installed. If you want to use another distribution, refer to the [custom installation procedure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install#change-the-default-linux-distribution-installed).  
:::

Once installing your Linux Distribution is complete, open the distribution (Ubuntu by default) using the Windows Start menu.

![Install Ubuntu command](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/wslInstall_02.png)

When you launch the distribution for the first time, you will be prompted to:

- Choose a **User Name**
- Choose a **Password**

These credentials apply only to your Linux environment and do not affect your Windows account.  
Once created, this user will be your default account and you will be signed in automatically on each launch.

![Ubuntu User Account](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/wslInstall_03.png)

:::info This account is considered a **Linux Administrator**. You can run `sudo` administrative commands.  
:::

## Install Make

:::warning These commands must be executed in your Linux distribution console.  
:::

To install Make on your Linux distribution, start by updating your package list with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
```

Then, run the following command to install Make:

```bash
sudo apt-get -y install make
```

You can check if Make has been installed correctly with:

```bash
make -v
```

---

## Install GitKraken

:::warning These commands must be executed in your Linux distribution console.  
:::

First you have to download GitKraken package using the following command:

```bash
wget https://api.gitkraken.dev/releases/production/linux/x64/active/gitkraken-amd64.deb
```

Once the download is complete, run the following command to install the downloaded package:

```bash
sudo apt install ./gitkraken-amd64.deb
```

Once GitKraken is installed, you can start it with:

```bash
gitkraken
```

:::warning Windows 10 GitKraken requires a graphical environment.  
 On Windows 11, this works out of the box thanks to WSLg. On Windows 10, you must install an X11 server such as VcXsrv.

## Clone Repository

Repository link : https://github.com/DyingStar-game/technical-docs

:::warning These commands must be executed in your Linux distribution console.  
:::

With Ubuntu open, to launch GitKraken, enter the command in the console :

```bash
gitkraken
```

When the application opens, select `File` → `Clone Repo...` Choose the folder where you want to clone the repository, paste the [technical-doc](https://github.com/DyingStar-game/technical-docs) repository URL, and click `Clone the repo!`.

After cloning, a banner will appear at the top of GitKraken offering to open the newly cloned repository.

## Install Docker

Docker Desktop : https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop

:::warning WSL must be installed before starting the installation.  
:::

Start by downloading the Docker Desktop installer from the [product page](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

<details>
    <summary>Choose the right version of Windows for the installer to download!</summary>

    If you don't know which version of Windows (AMD64 or ARM64) you are using, the information can be found in **Settings** -> **System Information**

    ![Download Docker Desktop](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/dockerInstall01.png)

</details>

![Download Docker Desktop](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/dockerInstall02.png)

Once downloaded, launch the Docker Desktop installation:

:::warning Make sure “Use WSL 2 instead of Hyper-V” is checked in Docker Desktop settings.  
:::

![Install Docker Desktop](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/dockerInstall03.gif)  
_Docker Desktop may require a reboot to finish installing components._

You can log in to your Docker account or create a new one / proceed without logging in:

![Connect to Docker Desktop](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/dockerInstall05.png)

Docker is now installed and running!

## Project Start-Up

To open the project from your Linux distribution, start by navigating to its location on the disk using the following command:

```bash
cd path/to/project
```

In our case here:

```bash
cd Git/DyingStar/technical-docs/
```

Then run the command to open Visual Studio Code from the current folder:

```bash
code .
```

![Open Remote Project](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/projectStartup01.gif)

Once the project is open, you can build the development environment using the following command in the Visual Studio Code terminal:

```bash
make up
```

Ensure that the project dependencies are installed with the command:

```bash
make pnpm install
```

You can now run the local server by entering:

```bash
make pnpm start
```

![Open Remote Project](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/projectStartup02.gif)

Once the development server has been started and the client compiled, open your browser and enter the following address in your URL bar:

[`http://localhost:3000/`](http://localhost:3000/)

![Open Remote Project](/img/project/localDocEnvironment/projectStartup03.png)

The local version of the website will be displayed once the project has been built and the page loaded.  
You can now start editing the documentation!
